# Surfs_Up

## Overview
The purpose of this analysis is to help determine if the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round.

## Results
* The minimum temperature for December is only 56 degrees compared to the 64 degrees in June. Some may find this too cold in Dec.
* The maximum temperature for June an December are over 80 degrees (85 and 83 respectively). On the warm days it should still be good to serve ice cream.
* The mean and median of both data sets are very close to each other. This means that the data is not skewed so the temperatures are fairly evenly distributed around the mean/median.

## Summary
Overall the ice cream should be sustanable year round as the temperatures are mostly high enough to sustain business.

### Other Queries
1. I would like to see what the temperature is like in January and February as december is just the Beginnning of winter.
2. I would like to see if we could get wind data to see if there are times where it is too windy to be out getting ice cream.
